# Keimyung University: Game Project 2 Spring 2021

## Description

This is our project for the Module _Game project 2_ of Spring semester 2021.

The main character has some problems/fears (etc…) in real life and he has to solve them thanks to his dreams to advance in real life.
The player’s goal is to help the character to overcome its problems by solving some puzzles from the world of dreams.
The aim of this is to make the player understand that all fears can be fought and if they are, your life should become better.
